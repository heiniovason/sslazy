# SSLazy

**warning:** I'm not an expert on windows security, and this code has not been used for any production system, but merely a proof of concept.

The program iterates all underlying nodes in both *StoreLocation* and *StoreName* when it tries to look up a given certificate. So if you plan on being inspired by this code then please do a security assessment of what impact this could have. I havent gotten around to do this, yet.


## How to (on windows)

1) Get a PKCS12 certificate from from https://badssl.com/download/
2) Install the certificate
3) Run --> mmc, find the certificate, and copy the thumbprint
4) Download and build the SSLazy project
5) Run Powershell, or Command Prompt as admin

```sh
$ cd \path\to\SSLazy\TryItOut\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\
$ .\TryItOut.exe 41c36c33c7e336ddea4a1fc0b723b8e69cdcd80f https://client.badssl.com/
